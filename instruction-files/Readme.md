# Map Search Test

## Base Files

You've been given:

1. `index.html`: The base HTML file with a full-page Google Map
1. `main.css`: The base CSS file
1. `main.js`: The base JS file
1. `hiking-data.js`: The sample data that should be searched. Each record has _at least_ an `id` and `name`.
1. `icon-search.svg` & `icon-pin.svg`: SVG's to use in your design _(see the provided designs below)_

## The Task

Create a user interface **that resembles the images below** as closely as possible and implements the following:

1. "Autocomplete" search field - Using the provided sample data in `hiking-data.js`, allow users to search in an input field for results based on the data `name` value.
1. Results list - Show the results of the autocomplete search as a list of items that a user can select/click.
1. Locations/markers - When a user finds and clicks a search result, display the location on the map.
1. Details modal - When a user clicks a map location/marker, display a modal that contains additional information about that location. (see below)

**How the initial page should look:**

### Search Field

When entering a query into the search field the matching results should populate an area below the search **as a user types**. If no results are found, make sure to show a message letting a user know that :) _Nothing is worse than thinking it's trying to load forever!_

**How the search interface should look:**

![Search results](./test-example-search.png?raw=true)

### Details Modal

When clicking on a map location/marker you should display a modal that contains information about that specific location. **This modal should be both horizontally and vertically aligned.**

**How the modal should look - _(ignore the vertical line guides in your design)_:**

## Things to think about

- Document your code! This is your opportunity to help us understand you. Let us know:
  - why you did (or did not) do something,
  - why you used (or did not use) any frameworks/libraries,
  - what you wanted to do, but could not because...?
- How close does your final design match the provided images above?

## Extra Credit

- We use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) for our user interface at **Ground Signal**. If you find it useful for this exercise, by all means give it a go!
- We also implement _lots_ of charts using [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org/). We've included some data (see `avgStoreTraffic`) in the `hiking-data.js` in case you want to spice up your modal with that.
- Let us know how we could improve this test. Bug? Improvement? Send us a pull request!
- Anything else awesome. :)
